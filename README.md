## Context
The idea to develop this app appeared to solve a specific issue: the assistant coach of my volleyball team used to give us warmup exercises with several papers in his hand. So, I thought it would be a good idea to offer him an app to store the warmup exercises at the Secret Santa gift exchange. From that time, the app requirements increased and the app developed from just a place to store warmups to a complete gym assistant.

## Requirements
- Store gym workouts without internet usage;
- Generate random workouts;
- Share workout plans;
- Implement timer and Tabata timer;
- Record the user evolution in gym exercises and health (weight, body fat and muscle);
- Define and store objectives;
- Show to the user some statistics of the workouts made.
